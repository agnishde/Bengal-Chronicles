## üêØ Bengal Chronicle

Welcome to the Bengal Chronicle! This project aims to showcase and preserve Bengal's rich cultural heritage using innovative technological solutions.

## Overview
The Bengal Chronicle is designed to address the problem of limited access to Bengal's cultural heritage. It provides users with immersive experiences, making it easier to explore, learn, and appreciate the rich history and culture of Bengal.

## Features
- Virtual Tour: Explore historical sites in Bengal through an immersive virtual experience using Google Maps Embedded API.
- Image Recognition: Utilize TensorFlow for recognizing and providing information about various cultural artifacts.
- Historical Timeline: An interactive timeline that presents key events and landmarks in Bengal's history.

## Goals
- Enhance user engagement with Bengal's cultural heritage.
- Provide easy access to historical information and artifacts.
- Utilize cutting-edge technology to offer innovative solutions for cultural preservation.
  
## Technologies Used
- React: For building the front-end user interface.
- React Router: For routing and navigation within the application.
- TensorFlow: For image recognition capabilities.
- Google Maps Embedded API: For creating the virtual tour feature.
- Vertical Timeline: For implementing the historical timeline feature.

  
## Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

## npm start
- Runs the app in the development mode.
- Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

## The page will reload when you make changes.
## You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

## npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

## npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

- If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

- Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

- You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
You can learn more in the Create React App documentation.
